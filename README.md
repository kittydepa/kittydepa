## Hi there ðŸ‘‹ I'm Kitty

Welcome to my GitHub!  
Iâ€™m passionate about user experience, technological innovation, and making complex ideas clear through great documentation. I thrive at the intersection of research, engineering, and communication.

## ðŸš€ What I Do

- **Technical Writing & Documentation:**  
  I create, review, and improve documentation for software teams â€” from SDKs and APIs to user guides and developer portals. I love making docs useful and usable.

- **Software Development Life Cycle Experience:**  
  I work with cross-functional teams to streamline tooling and workflows, especially for (but not limited to) Docs-as-Code setups and automation in documentation.

- **Python & Automation:**  
  I like to (try to) build with Python, experiment with microcontrollers, and enjoy exploring automation solutions.

- **Community & Learning:**  
  As a co-organiser for PyLadies Stockholm, I hold workshops and study groups to help others learn Python and build community.
