# Hi there ðŸ‘‹ I'm Kitty

## ðŸš€ What I Do

- **Technical Writing & Documentation:**  
  I create, review, and improve documentation for software teams â€” from SDKs and APIs to user guides and developer portals. I love making docs useful and usable.

- **Software Development Life Cycle Experience:**  
  I work with cross-functional teams to streamline tooling and workflows, especially for (but not limited to) Docs-as-Code setups and automation in documentation.

- **Python & Automation:**  
  I like to (try to) build with Python, experiment with microcontrollers, and enjoy exploring automation solutions.

##  What I'm Exploring

- LLMs & Generative AI
- Video game design & creation
- New ways to document APIs & developer tools
- Leatherworking, knitting, & embroidery (for fun!)
