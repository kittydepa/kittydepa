Hi, I'm Kitty :wave:

Here's what I do: 
- **Technical Writing:** Create, review, and improve software docs (SDKs, APIs, user guides).
- **Software Development Life Cycle:** Streamline tooling and workflows, especially for Docs-as-Code and automation.
- **Python & Automation:** Build with Python, explore microcontrollers, and experiment with automation.
